# Analysis Insights

## Deforestation pattern
- **Red → Gray transition**: Clear-cutting patterns along roads/rivers.
- **Major loss**: Brazil (80% of shown deforestation).
- **Annual composites**: Cloud-masked median reduces noise.

## False-color science
NIR(Red channel) drops when trees removed → bright red → dull colors. [web:30][web:32]

## Limitations
- 30m Landsat resolution misses small clearings.
- 2012 (L7) has scan-line issues (minimal).
